**How did I use these learning materials ?**
1. Firstly, start by reading the book (1) and taking notes if necessary. Questions and exercises are at the end of each chapter for you guys to revise.
2. Read or watch videos on Udemy or any digital learning platform about additional modules/parts of version 4.0 (see attachment)
3. Do the mock exams (3) - don't need to put in exactly 75 minutes, the aim of this is to verify your knowledge and write down what you misunderstand. 
4. Check your answers and read the explanation carefully --> why it's true, why it's false, and what are your mistakes.
5. Based on the sample exams (3), summarise the number of questions in each chapter and the main content of those questions.
--> From my exp, I found that there is one question for each test technique (2 or 3-value BVA, EP, ...), one for each Configuration management, Defect report, Testing tools and Pros/Cons of test automation part.
---> Structure (you can find it on the ISTQB homepage)
- Chapter 1: 8 questions
- Chapter 2: 6 questions
- Chapter 3: 4 questions
- Chapter 4: 11 questions
- Chapter 5: 9 questions
- Chapter 6: 2 questions
6. Read the syllabus (2) to sum up knowledge.
7. Do the mock exams (3) again or another until you can resolve your problems.
8. Get ready for the real exam!
------------------------
Small notes:
1. The Electronic Exam presents questions in no particular order, but you can mark any for later review.
2. Don't try to learn by heart, try to get it deeply in your own language. 

- ## Preparations üìú :
1. Prepare those chapters first that have high weightage
2. You need to understand below terms and read the syllabus accordingly.
- K1 = Remember
- K2 = Understand
- K3 = Apply 
(You will get a practical implementation question from topics where K3 is written so no need to waste time reading theory of such topics. Just understand and practice solving their questions)
3. I would suggest reading at least one chapter a day. If a chapter is very long then you can take up to 2 days but not longer than that.
4. If you want to watch a free video course
then I recommend this playlist: https://lnkd.in/d3UE5nKh
 
- ## Pro Tips üí° :
1. Focus on the syllabus of ISTQB website
only.
2. Try to solve sample exams available there in an exam like setting within 60 min. This will give you an
understanding of where you stand and which areas you need to improve.
3. Practice solving as many questions as you can. The more you practice, the better the results.
