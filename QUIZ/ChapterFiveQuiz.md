    a) They are slow and check large functionalities  
    b) They are fast, isolated, and numerous  
    c) They are manual and business-facing  
    d) They focus on user acceptance testing  
    **Correct Answer**: b) They are fast, isolated, and numerous  
    **Explanation**: Bottom-layer tests (e.g., unit tests) are fast, isolated, and numerous, checking small pieces of functionality.
    
8.  **Which testing quadrant includes exploratory and usability testing?** (FL-5.1.7)  
    a) Q1 (Technology-facing, support team)  
    b) Q2 (Business-facing, support team)  
    c) Q3 (Business-facing, critique product)  
    d) Q4 (Technology-facing, critique product)  
    **Correct Answer**: c) Q3 (Business-facing, critique product)  
    **Explanation**: Q3 includes manual, user-oriented tests like exploratory and usability testing.
    
9.  **How is risk level determined in risk management?** (FL-5.2.1)  
    a) By the number of test cases executed  
    b) By combining risk likelihood and risk impact  
    c) By the availability of test resources  
    d) By the number of defects found  
    **Correct Answer**: b) By combining risk likelihood and risk impact  
    **Explanation**: Risk level is a measure derived from the probability (likelihood) and consequences (impact) of a risk.
    
10.  **Which of the following is an example of a project risk?** (FL-5.2.2)  
    a) Incorrect calculations in the software  
    b) Delays in work product deliveries  
    c) Poor user experience  
    d) Security vulnerabilities  
    **Correct Answer**: b) Delays in work product deliveries  
    **Explanation**: Project risks relate to management issues like delays, while product risks involve quality issues like incorrect calculations.
    
11.  **How does product risk analysis influence testing?** (FL-5.2.3)  
    a) It determines the programming language used  
    b) It influences the thoroughness and scope of testing  
    c) It defines the test environment setup  
    d) It sets the project budget  
    **Correct Answer**: b) It influences the thoroughness and scope of testing  
    **Explanation**: Product risk analysis prioritizes testing efforts on high-risk areas, affecting test thoroughness and scope.
    
12.  **Which metric is commonly used in test monitoring?** (FL-5.3.1)  
    a) Number of lines of code written  
    b) Defect detection percentage  
    c) Number of developers in the team  
    d) Project budget allocation  
    **Correct Answer**: b) Defect detection percentage  
    **Explanation**: Defect metrics, like detection percentage, track testing effectiveness and product quality.
    
13.  **What is typically included in a test progress report?** (FL-5.3.2)  
    a) Detailed code review findings  
    b) Test progress and impediments for testing  
    c) Final product deployment plan  
    d) Employee performance evaluations  
    **Correct Answer**: b) Test progress and impediments for testing  
    **Explanation**: Test progress reports detail testing period, progress, impediments, metrics, risks, and plans for the next period.
    
14.  **Which method is suitable for communicating test status in a distributed team?** (FL-5.3.3)  
    a) Face-to-face meetings only  
    b) Formal test reports  
    c) Code comments  
    d) Whiteboard sketches  
    **Correct Answer**: b) Formal test reports  
    **Explanation**: Formal test reports are suitable for distributed teams where face-to-face communication is limited.
    
15.  **How does configuration management support testing?** (FL-5.4.1)  
    a) By writing test cases for developers  
    b) By ensuring traceability and version control of test items
