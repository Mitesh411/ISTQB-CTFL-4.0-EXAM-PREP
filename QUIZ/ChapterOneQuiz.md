# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Testing [ QUIZ ]

1.  **What is a primary objective of software testing?**  
    a) To ensure the software is completely defect-free  
    b) To validate that the software meets stakeholder needs  
    c) To replace the need for debugging  
    d) To eliminate the need for quality assurance  
    **Answer**: ***b) To validate that the software meets stakeholder needs***
    
2.  **How does testing differ from debugging?**  
    a) Testing fixes defects, while debugging identifies them  
    b) Testing identifies defects or triggers failures, while debugging diagnoses and fixes defects  
    c) Testing is performed only statically, while debugging is dynamic  
    d) Testing is a process-oriented activity, while debugging is product-oriented  
    **Answer**: ***b) Testing identifies defects or triggers failures, while debugging diagnoses and fixes defects***
    
3.  **Which of the following is a testing principle?**  
    a) Testing proves the absence of defects  
    b) Exhaustive testing is always feasible  
    c) Defects cluster together in a small number of components  
    d) Testing is independent of context  
    **Answer**: **c) Defects cluster together in a small number of components**
    
4.  **What is the main difference between testing and quality assurance (QA)?**  
    a) Testing is process-oriented, while QA is product-oriented  
    b) Testing focuses on defect detection, while QA focuses on process improvement  
    c) Testing is performed only by testers, while QA is performed by developers  
    d) Testing ensures compliance with regulations, while QA does not  
    **Answer**: ***b) Testing focuses on defect detection, while QA focuses on process improvement***
    
5.  **Which activity is part of the test implementation phase?**  
    a) Defining test objectives and approach  
    b) Creating test data and test scripts  
    c) Comparing actual progress against the test plan  
    d) Analyzing lessons learned for future projects  
    **Answer**: ***b) Creating test data and test scripts***
    
6.  **Why is traceability between the test basis and testware important?**  
    a) It ensures all defects are fixed during debugging  
    b) It supports coverage evaluation and impact analysis  
    c) It eliminates the need for test automation  
    d) It replaces the need for test planning  
    **Answer**: ***b) It supports coverage evaluation and impact analysis***
    
7.  **Which skill is particularly relevant for testers to effectively identify defects?**  
    a) Project management  
    b) Thoroughness and attention to detail  
    c) Knowledge of hardware design  
    d) Financial analysis  
    **Answer**: ***b) Thoroughness and attention to detail***
    
8.  **What is a benefit of the whole team approach in testing?**  
    a) It ensures complete independence of testers  
    b) It enhances collaboration and leverages diverse skill sets  
    c) It eliminates the need for test automation  
    d) It reduces the need for stakeholder involvement  
    **Answer**: **b) It enhances collaboration and leverages diverse skill sets**
    
9.  **What is a drawback of high independence in testing?**  
    a) Independent testers may find fewer defects  
    b) It may lead to isolation from the development team  
    c) It eliminates the need for communication skills  
    d) It ensures all defects are found  
    **Answer**: ***b) It may lead to isolation from the development team***
    
10.  **What does the testing principle "absence-of-defects fallacy" imply?**  
    a) Defect-free software guarantees user satisfaction  
    b) Testing can prove the absence of defects  
    c) Fixing all defects may not meet user needs or business goals  
    d) Defects are evenly distributed across components  
    **Answer**: ***c) Fixing all defects may not meet user needs or business goals***
