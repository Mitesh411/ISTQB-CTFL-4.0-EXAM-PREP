4.  **What is the main difference between testing and quality assurance (QA)?**  
    a) Testing is process-oriented, while QA is product-oriented  
    b) Testing focuses on defect detection, while QA focuses on process improvement  
    c) Testing is performed only by testers, while QA is performed by developers  
    d) Testing ensures compliance with regulations, while QA does not  
    **Answer**: ***b) Testing focuses on defect detection, while QA focuses on process improvement***
    
5.  **Which activity is part of the test implementation phase?**  
    a) Defining test objectives and approach  
    b) Creating test data and test scripts  
    c) Comparing actual progress against the test plan  
    d) Analyzing lessons learned for future projects  
    **Answer**: ***b) Creating test data and test scripts***
    
6.  **Why is traceability between the test basis and testware important?**  
    a) It ensures all defects are fixed during debugging  
    b) It supports coverage evaluation and impact analysis  
    c) It eliminates the need for test automation  
    d) It replaces the need for test planning  
    **Answer**: ***b) It supports coverage evaluation and impact analysis***
    
7.  **Which skill is particularly relevant for testers to effectively identify defects?**  
    a) Project management  
    b) Thoroughness and attention to detail  
    c) Knowledge of hardware design  
    d) Financial analysis  
    **Answer**: ***b) Thoroughness and attention to detail***
    
8.  **What is a benefit of the whole team approach in testing?**  
    a) It ensures complete independence of testers  
    b) It enhances collaboration and leverages diverse skill sets  
    c) It eliminates the need for test automation  
    d) It reduces the need for stakeholder involvement  
    **Answer**: **b) It enhances collaboration and leverages diverse skill sets**
    
9.  **What is a drawback of high independence in testing?**  
    a) Independent testers may find fewer defects  
    b) It may lead to isolation from the development team  
    c) It eliminates the need for communication skills  
    d) It ensures all defects are found  
    **Answer**: ***b) It may lead to isolation from the development team***
    
10.  **What does the testing principle "absence-of-defects fallacy" imply?**  
    a) Defect-free software guarantees user satisfaction  
    b) Testing can prove the absence of defects  
    c) Fixing all defects may not meet user needs or business goals  
    d) Defects are evenly distributed across components  
    **Answer**: ***c) Fixing all defects may not meet user needs or business goals***
