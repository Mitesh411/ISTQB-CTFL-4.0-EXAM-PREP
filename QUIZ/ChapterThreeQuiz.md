## Chapter 3: Static Testing

### Question 1

Which of the following work products is typically NOT suitable for static testing?

A. Requirement specification documents  
B. Source code  
C. Third-party executable code  
D. Test plans

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: Third-party executable code is typically not suitable for static testing due to legal constraints, as it is difficult to interpret by humans and should not be analyzed by tools.

### Question 2

What is a key difference between static testing and dynamic testing?

A. Static testing requires executable code, while dynamic testing does not.  
B. Static testing finds defects directly, while dynamic testing identifies defects through failures.  
C. Static testing can only be applied to executable work products.  
D. Dynamic testing is performed early in the SDLC, while static testing is performed later.

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Static testing identifies defects directly (e.g., through reviews or static analysis), while dynamic testing causes failures that require analysis to identify defects.

### Question 3

What is a primary benefit of early and frequent stakeholder feedback in static testing?

A. It increases the cost of the review process.  
B. It ensures defects are only found during dynamic testing.  
C. It prevents misunderstandings about requirements and reduces rework.  
D. It eliminates the need for formal reviews.

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: Early and frequent feedback helps align development with stakeholder needs, preventing misunderstandings and reducing costly rework.

### Question 4

Which role in a review process is responsible for ensuring effective review meetings and creating a safe environment for discussion?

A. Author  
B. Moderator  
C. Scribe  
D. Manager

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The moderator facilitates review meetings, manages time, mediates discussions, and ensures a safe environment for open communication.

### Question 5

Which review type is the most formal and follows the complete generic review process to maximize anomaly detection?

A. Informal review  
B. Walkthrough  
C. Technical review  
D. Inspection

**Correct Answer**: D  
**Explanation**: Inspection is the most formal review type, following the full review process, focusingSubnet on detecting the maximum number of anomalies, and collecting metrics for process improvement.
