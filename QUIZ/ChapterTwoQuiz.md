    b) Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
    c) V-model  
    d) Big-bang integration  
    **Answer**: ***b) Test-Driven Development (TDD)***
    
14.  **What is a benefit of DevOps for testing?**  
    a) It eliminates the need for manual testing  
    b) It reduces regression risk through automated testing  
    c) It removes the need for test environments  
    d) It ensures all testing is performed manually  
    **Answer**: ***b) It reduces regression risk through automated testing***
    
15.  **What does the "shift left" approach in testing emphasize?**  
    a) Performing testing only at the end of the SDLC  
    b) Conducting testing earlier in the SDLC  
    c) Eliminating the need for non-functional testing  
    d) Focusing solely on regression testing  
    **Answer**: ***b) Conducting testing earlier in the SDLC***
    
16.  **What is a key benefit of retrospectives in testing?**  
    a) They ensure all defects are fixed  
    b) They support continuous process improvement  
    c) They eliminate the need for test planning  
    d) They replace the need for test automation  
    **Answer**: ***b) They support continuous process improvement***
    
17.  **Which test level focuses on testing the interfaces between components?**  
    a) Component testing  
    b) System testing  
    c) Component integration testing  
    d) Acceptance testing  
    **Answer**: ***c) Component integration testing***
    
18.  **What is the main objective of non-functional testing?**  
    a) To verify what the system does  
    b) To check how well the system behaves  
    c) To test the internal structure of the system  
    d) To ensure all defects are fixed  
    **Answer**: ***b) To check how well the system behaves***
    
19.  **How does confirmation testing differ from regression testing?**  
    a) Confirmation testing checks for new defects, while regression testing fixes defects  
    b) Confirmation testing verifies defect fixes, while regression testing ensures no new issues from changes  
    c) Confirmation testing is always automated, while regression testing is manual  
    d) Confirmation testing is performed only at the system level, while regression testing is at the component level  
    **Answer**: ***b) Confirmation testing verifies defect fixes, while regression testing ensures no new issues from changes***
    
20.  **What is a common trigger for maintenance testing?**  
    a) Developing a new system from scratch  
    b) Modifying an operational system with enhancements or fixes  
    c) Eliminating the need for regression testing  
    d) Performing only black-box testing  
    **Answer**: ***b) Modifying an operational system with enhancements or fixes***
