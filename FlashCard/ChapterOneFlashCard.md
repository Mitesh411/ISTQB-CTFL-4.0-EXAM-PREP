### 1. What is Testing?

**Q:** **What is the main purpose of software testing?**  
**A:** To assess software quality and help reduce the risk of software failure in operation by discovering defects and evaluating the quality of software work products.

**Q:** **What are test objects?**  
**A:** Work products that are being tested.

**Q:** **Does software testing only involve executing tests?**  
**A:** No, it also includes other activities aligned with the software development lifecycle, such as planning, monitoring, and analysis.

**Q:** **What is the difference between verification and validation in testing?**  
**A:** Verification checks if the system meets specified requirements, while validation checks if the system meets users’ and stakeholders’ needs in its operational environment.

**Q:** **What is the difference between dynamic and static testing?** 
**A:** Dynamic testing involves executing software; static testing does not (it includes reviews and static analysis).

### 2. Test Objectives

**Q:** **List typical objectives of testing.**  
**A:**

-   Evaluating work products
    
-   Causing failures and finding defects
    
-   Ensuring required coverage
    
-   Reducing the risk level
    
-   Verifying specified requirements
    
-   Verifying compliance with requirements
    
-   Providing information to stakeholders
    
-   Building confidence in quality
    
-   Validating completeness and expected operation
    

**Q:** **Do test objectives vary? Why?**  
**A:** Yes, they vary depending on context, such as the work product, test level, risks, SDLC followed, and business factors.

### 3. Testing vs Debugging

**Q:** **How does testing differ from debugging?**  
**A:** Testing triggers failures (dynamic) or finds defects (static); debugging involves finding the cause, analyzing, and removing defects.

**Q:** **What are the steps of debugging after a failure is found in dynamic testing?**  
**A:**

1.  Reproduction of a failure
    
2.  Diagnosis (finding the defect)
    
3.  Fixing the defect
    
4.  Confirmation testing
    
5.  Regression testing

### 4. Why is Testing Necessary?

**Q:** **Why is testing considered necessary in software development?**  
**A:** It detects defects cost-effectively, supports quality assurance, provides information for decisions, ensures compliance, and represents user interests.

**Q:** **What is the relation between testing and quality assurance (QA)?**  
**A:** Testing is product-oriented and corrective, focusing on achieving appropriate quality. QA is process-oriented and preventive, focusing on processes to ensure good products.

**Q:** **Define: Error, Defect, Failure, Root Cause.**  
**A:**

-   **Error:** Human mistake
    
-   **Defect (Fault/Bug):** Flaw produced by an error
    
-   **Failure:** Deviation from expected behavior when a defect is executed
    
-   **Root Cause:** Fundamental reason for an error/defect/failure

### 5. Seven Testing Principles

**Q:** **What are the seven testing principles?**  
**A:**

1.  Testing shows presence, not absence of defects
    
2.  Exhaustive testing is impossible
    
3.  Early testing saves time and money
    
4.  Defects cluster together
    
5.  Tests wear out
    
6.  Testing is context dependent
    
7.  Absence-of-defects fallacy
    

**Q:** **Explain the “absence-of-defects fallacy.”**  
**A:** Even if all requirements are verified and all found defects are fixed, the system may still not fulfill users’ needs or business goals.

### 6. Test Activities, Testware, and Test Roles

**Q:** **List the main test activities in the test process.**  
**A:**

1.  Test planning
    
2.  Test monitoring and control
    
3.  Test analysis
    
4.  Test design
    
5.  Test implementation
    
6.  Test execution
    
7.  Test completion
    

**Q:** **What is testware? Give examples.**  
**A:** Work products produced during test activities, such as test plans, test cases, test scripts, test logs, and test completion reports.

**Q:** **What is traceability in testing and why is it important?**  
**A:** Traceability links test basis, testware, test results, and defects, supporting coverage evaluation, impact analysis, audits, and stakeholder communication.

**Q:** **What are the two principal roles in testing?**  
**A:**

-   **Test Management Role:** Responsible for overall test process, planning, and leadership
    
-   **Testing Role:** Responsible for technical aspects like analysis, design, implementation, execution

### 7. Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing

**Q:** **List generic skills required for testing.**  
**A:**

-   Testing knowledge
    
-   Thoroughness, attention to detail
    
-   Communication and teamwork
    
-   Analytical and critical thinking
    
-   Technical and domain knowledge
    

**Q:** **What is the whole team approach?**  
**A:** Practice where any team member can perform testing tasks and everyone is responsible for quality, improving collaboration and communication.

**Q:** **What are the benefits and drawbacks of independent testing?**  
**A:**

-   **Benefits:** Different perspectives, more defect detection, challenge assumptions
    
-   **Drawbacks:** Possible isolation, communication issues, perceived as bottleneck
