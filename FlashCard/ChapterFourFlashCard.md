### Flashcards – Chapter 4: Test Analysis and Design

----------

Q1: What is test analysis?  
A1: The process of identifying test conditions from the test basis such as requirements, user stories, and risks.

----------

Q2: What is a test basis?  
A2: The source of information used to create test cases, such as specifications or user stories.

----------

Q3: What does test coverage measure?  
A3: The extent to which the test basis has been covered by the test conditions and test cases.

----------

Q4: What are black-box test techniques?  
A4: Techniques based on system behavior and requirements, not internal code. Examples: EP, BVA, decision tables.

----------

Q5: What is Equivalence Partitioning (EP)?  
A5: Dividing input data into partitions where test cases from one partition are considered to be the same.

----------

Q6: What is Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)?  
A6: Testing at the edges of input partitions where defects are more likely to occur.

----------

Q7: What is a decision table?  
A7: A matrix used to model complex business rules involving combinations of conditions and actions.

----------

Q8: What is state transition testing?  
A8: A technique used when behavior changes based on system states and transitions.

----------

Q9: What is statement testing?  
A9: A white-box technique ensuring every line of code is executed at least once.

----------

Q10: What is branch testing?  
A10: A white-box technique testing all decision outcomes (true and false paths).

----------

Q11: What is exploratory testing?  
A11: An experience-based approach where tests are designed and executed simultaneously while learning the system.

----------

Q12: What is error guessing?  
A12: Designing tests based on the tester’s intuition and experience about where defects might be.

----------

Q13: What is checklist-based testing?  
A13: Using a predefined list of conditions or criteria to guide testing.

----------

Q14: What are collaboration-based approaches?  
A14: Techniques like ATDD, BDD, and Specification by Example, where tests are derived collaboratively using real-world examples.

----------

Q15: What factors influence the choice of test technique?  
A15: Project risks, documentation quality, tester experience, and the nature of the system.
