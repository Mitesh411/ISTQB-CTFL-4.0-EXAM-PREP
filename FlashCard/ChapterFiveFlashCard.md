A1: To define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.

----------

Q2: What are key elements of a test plan?  
A2: Test objectives, test scope, test environment, resources, schedule, risks, and deliverables.

----------

Q3: What is test monitoring?  
A3: The process of checking the status of testing activities and comparing them to the plan.

----------

Q4: What is test control?  
A4: Taking corrective actions based on test monitoring to meet the objectives.

----------

Q5: What metrics are used in test monitoring?  
A5: Test progress, defect density, pass/fail rates, test coverage, and test execution status.

----------

Q6: What is risk-based testing?  
A6: A testing approach where tests are prioritized based on the level of risk.

----------

Q7: What are the steps in risk management?  
A7: Risk identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and risk monitoring.

Q9: What is defect management?  
A9: The process of identifying, recording, analyzing, prioritizing, fixing, and verifying defects.

----------

Q10: What are common defect attributes in a defect report?  
A10: ID, summary, severity, priority, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, status.

----------

Q11: What is the difference between severity and priority?  
A11: Severity is the impact of the defect; priority is the urgency of fixing it.

----------

Q12: What is test estimation?  
A12: Predicting the effort, time, and resources needed for testing activities.

----------

Q13: What techniques are used for test estimation?  
A13: Experience-based, metrics-based, and work breakdown structure (WBS).

----------

Q14: What is test prioritization?  
A14: Ranking test activities or test cases to focus on the most critical aspects first.

----------

Q15: Why is defect lifecycle important?  
A15: It ensures proper tracking and resolution of defects from discovery to closure.
