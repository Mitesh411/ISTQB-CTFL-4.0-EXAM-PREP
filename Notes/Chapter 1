# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Testing

**1.1 What is Testing?**

- *Software testing is a critical process aimed at discovering defects and evaluating the quality of software work products, known as test objects. It reduces the risk of software failures that could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, or even harm. Testing is not limited to executing tests but includes activities aligned with the software development lifecycle (SDLC), such as verification (ensuring the system meets specified requirements) and validation (ensuring it meets user needs). Testing can be dynamic (executing software) or static (e.g., reviews or static analysis). It requires planning, management, and intellectual skills like analytical and critical thinking.*

**Test Objectives:**





- *Evaluate work products (e.g., requirements, designs, code).*



- *Identify defects and cause failures.*



- *Ensure coverage of test objects.*



- *Reduce risks of poor software quality.*



- *Verify compliance with requirements and regulations.*



- *Provide stakeholders with quality-related information.*



- *Validate functionality and stakeholder expectations.*


**Testing vs. Debugging:**





- *Testing identifies defects (static testing) or triggers failures (dynamic testing).*



- *Debugging involves reproducing failures, diagnosing defects, and fixing them, followed by confirmation and regression testing to ensure fixes are effective and do not introduce new issues.*
