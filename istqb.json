  {
    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "What is the difference between testing and debugging?",
    "backside": "Testing involves identifying defects by triggering failures in a software system, while debugging refers to locating, analyzing, and fixing defects identified during testing."

  {
    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "Explain the principle 'Early testing'.",
    "backside": "Testing activities should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle and should be focused on defined objectives. Defects that are removed early in the process will not cause subsequent defects in derived work products."

    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "What is the 'Pesticide paradox' principle?",
    "backside": "If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually these tests will no longer find new defects. To overcome this, the tests need to be regularly reviewed and revised, and new and different tests need to be written."

  {
    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "Explain the principle 'Defect clustering'.",
    "backside": "A small number of modules usually contain most of the defects discovered during pre-release testing or are responsible for most of the operational failures."

  },
  {
    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "What does the principle 'Testing shows the presence of defects' mean?",
    "backside": "Testing can show that defects are present but cannot prove that there are no defects. It reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but cannot guarantee that the software is defect-free."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "What are the activities in test completion?",
    "backside": "Test completion activities ensure that the testware is archived, the environment is restored, test logs are finalized, and relevant stakeholders are informed of the results."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "Define test planning.",
    "backside": "Test planning involves defining the objectives of testing and the approach for meeting those objectives within constraints."

    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "Define test design.",
    "backside": "Test design involves creating and prioritizing test cases and identifying the necessary test data to support the defined test conditions."

    "chapter": "1",
    "frontside": "What is test implementation?",
    "backside": "Test implementation is the activity where test cases, test data, and other testware are created, assembled, and verified as complete."
